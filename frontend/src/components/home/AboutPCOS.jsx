      <p>
        Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder affecting
        women of reproductive age. It may cause irregular menstrual cycles,
        excessive androgen levels, infertility, weight gain, and metabolic
        complications.

        Early screening and lifestyle management can significantly reduce
        long-term health risks such as Type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
